CMake Warning (dev) at src/CMakeLists.txt:51 (target_sources):
  Policy CMP0076 is not set: target_sources() command converts relative paths
  to absolute.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0076" for policy details.  Use
  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  An interface source of target "sockpp-objs" has a relative path.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
